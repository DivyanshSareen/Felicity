# Contributing
So, you have thought of contributing to an open source project- great call! Let us begin now.

## Installing git
1. Go to the official site of git- https://git-scm.com/downloads and install git for your system.
2. Once you are installed, search for git bash in your system.

## Running this project on your local machine
It is super easy!. 
1. Go to our project and fork it.
2. Once you are done forking, go to the green button that says "clone" and you will get a link, copy it!
3. Go to git bash and type in "git clone [the link you copied]". This will clone the system on your local computer.
That is it!, open the folder with your favourite editor and start exploring

## Commiting code
Pay attention here! First check what your branch is, if it is master or main, change it because you never make a commit in the master branch as it is the main development branch. Hmm but how to check and change ? Read further!
1. type "git branch" to see the branch
2. type " git checkout [your username of github] "- this will make a new remote branch.
3. Now type "git status" and you will see all the changes you made in code.
4. Now we will add all those changes to staging area - type "git add ."- this will add all the files.
5. Next comes- "git commit -m "your message"" 
6. Lastly, write - "git push" and done!

Congratulations! you just made your first pull request. After the request is merged, we will review it and if it is a valuable addition, we will merge it!.

May the source be with you!.
