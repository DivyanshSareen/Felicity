# Felicity
## The only thing positive here is the environment!
Objective-
1. To teach people open source and web development with carefully commented pieces of code.
2. To show how an idea of helping others could be put into action with the help of technology.

The idea of this website is to bring positive and impactful stories from past and present which may impact the people positively.
Times have been tough and many of us have been not been at our best lately and/or are struggling with mental peace. The only idea behind this page was spreading hope, positivity and doing our bit to help other peeple in whichever way possible.
No place for sad happenings, only a place to get motivated, read happiness and deliver the best.
Yes, the world isn't perfect but we try to make it a bit better- one article at a time.
If you believe you can, you can.

# Tech stack used
The teck stack currently used in Html, CSS, Bootstrap but as we go further, Javascript, JQuery and NodeJs will be involved.


# AI-BOT
The bot was built using javascript. The idea was to use a web speech API to make it more interactive. However, it is not a
conversational bbut conventional chatbot and used to make people understand javascript in depth. If you have any doubts, kindly go through the code as the comments have been added explaining each line of code and you'll be good.

# Books
Currently we are accepting contributions for developing the books homepage wherein you can add the books which might help people overcome grief and sadness and give them hope. The homepage currently is again created with javascript counter. Have a look!
If you want to see how a counter is made using js, we suggest going through the books.html page and reading the code which is well commented for you to understand. Have a look at the page !
