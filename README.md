# Felicity
## The only thing positive here is the environment!
The idea of this website is to bring positive and impactful stories from past and present which may impact the people positively.
No place for sad happenings, only a place to get motivated, read happiness and deliver the best.
Yes, the world isn't perfect but we try to make it a bit better- one article at a time.
If you believe you can, you can.
